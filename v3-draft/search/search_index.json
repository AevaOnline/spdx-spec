An SPDX file is associated with a particular software package or set of packages and contains information about it in the SPDX format. 1.3 Why is a common format for data exchange needed? \u00b6 Companies and organizations (collectively \u201cOrganizations\u201d) are widely using and reusing open source and other software packages. Compliance with the associated licenses requires a set of analysis activities and due diligence that each Organization performs independently, which may include a manual and/or automated scan of software and identification of associated licenses followed by manual verification. Software development teams across the globe use the same open source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis activities. As a result, many groups are performing the same work leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information. The SPDX working group seeks to create a data exchange format so that information about software packages and related content may be collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time and improving data accuracy. 1.4 What does this specification cover? \u00b6 1.4.1 SPDX Document Creation Information: Meta data to associate analysis results with a specific version of the SPDX file and license for use, and provide information on how, when, and by whom the SPDX file was created. 1.4.2 Package Information: Facts that are common properties of the entire package. 1.4.3 File Information: Facts that are specific to each file included in the package. 1.4.4 Snippet Information: Facts that are specific to only a part of a file. 1.4.5 Other Licensing Information Detected: A way to capture information about and refer to licenses that are not on the SPDX License List. 1.4.6 Relationships Between SPDX Elements: Information on how Documents, Packages & Files relate to each other. 1.4.7 Annotations: Information about when and by whom the SPDX file was reviewed 1.5 What is not covered in the specification? \u00b6 1.5.1 Information that cannot be derived from an inspection (whether manual or using automated tools) of the package to be analyzed. 1.5.2 How the data stored in an SPDX file is used by the recipient. 1.5.3 Any identification of any patent(s) which may or may not relate to the package. 1.5.4 Legal interpretation of the licenses or any compliance actions that have been or may need to be taken. 1.5.5 Examples may contain ... which indicate detailed text specific to the SPDX Document 1.6 Format Requirements \u00b6 1.6.1 Must be in a human readable form. 1.6.2 Must be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write. 1.6.3 Must be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness independent of how it was generated (human or tool). 1.6.4 The SPDX file character set must support UTF-8 encoding. 1.6.5 Must permit automated specification syntax validation. 1.6.6 Resource Description Framework (RDF) can be used to represent this information, as can an annotated tag value flat text file. 1.6.7 Interoperability with an annotate tag:value format and the RDF format will be preserved. 1.6.8 Tags and RDF properties are case sensitive. 1.6.9 Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file. A suggested naming convention is to use *.spdx (for tag:value format) and *-spdx.rdf for RDF format. 1.6.10 The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use rdf:about=\"...\" to represent that a proper Universal Resource Indicator (URI) should be present. 1.7 Conformance \u00b6 1.7.1 A file can be designated an SPDX document, if it is compliant with the requirements of the SPDX Trademark License (See the SPDX Trademark Page). 1.7.2 The official copyright notice to be used with any verbatim reproduction and/or distribution of this SPDX Specification 3.0-DRAFT is: \"Official SPDX\u00ae Specification 3.0-DRAFT Copyright \u00a9 2010-2019 Linux Foundation and its Contributors.

For the most up-to-date version of the list see: http://spdx.org/licenses/. The SPDX License List can also be found here in Appendix I . One instance should be created for every unique license or licensing information reference detected in package that does not match one of the licenses on the SPDX License List. Each license instance should have the following fields. Fields: 6.1 License Identifier \u00b6 Purpose \u00b6 Provide a locally unique identifier to refer to licenses that are not found on the SPDX License List. This unique identifier can then be used in the packages and files sections of the SPDX file (sections 3 and 4 , respectively). Intent \u00b6 Create a human readable short form license identifier for a license not on the SPDX License List. This identifier should be unique within the SPDX file. In previous versions of SPDX, the references were required to be sequential numbers, but as of version 1.2, creators may specify references that are easier for humans to remember and mentally map. 6.1.3 Cardinality: Conditional (mandatory, one) if license is not on SPDX License List. 6.1.4 Data Format: \"LicenseRef-\" [idstring] where [idstring] is a unique string containing letters, numbers, . and/or - . 6.1.5 Tag: LicenseID: Examples: LicenseID: LicenseRef-1 LicenseID: LicenseRef-Beerware-4.2 6.1.6 RDF: Property spdx:licenseID in class spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo Examples: <ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about=\"licenseRef-1\"> <licenseId>LicenseRef-1</licenseId> </ExtractedLicensingInfo> <ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about=\"licenseRef-Beerware-4.2\"> <licenseId>LicenseRef-Beerware-4.2</licenseId> </ExtractedLicensingInfo> Extracted Text \u00b6 Purpose \u00b6 Provide a copy of the actual text of the license reference extracted from the package or file that is associated with the License Identifier to aid in future analysis.

TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. Definitions a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License. c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership. d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License. e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast. f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work. g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium. Fair Dealing Rights . Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws. License Grant . Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\"; c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. e. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes . The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. Restrictions . The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Limitation on Liability . EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f.

The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. Restrictions . The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. b.

A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1 AND BSD-3-Clause). SPDX License Expressions provides a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef- [idString] ; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g., AND , OR , WITH and + ). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid an SPDX License Expression in this section. The exact syntax of license expressions is described below in ABNF . idstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" ) license-id = \\ SPDX License List > license-exception-id = \\ SPDX License Exceptions > license-ref = [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring) simple-expression = license-id / license-id\"+\" / license-ref compound-expression = 1*1(simple-expression / simple-expression \"WITH\" license-exception-id / compound-expression \"AND\" compound-expression / compound-expression \"OR\" compound-expression ) / \"(\" compound-expression \")\" ) license-expression = 1*1(simple-expression / compound-expression) In the following sections we describe in more detail <license-expression> construct, a licensing expression string that enables a more accurate representation of the licensing terms of modern day software. A valid <license-expression> string consists of either: (i) a simple license expression, such as a single license identifier; or (ii) a more complex expression constructed by combining smaller valid expressions using Boolean license operators. There MUST NOT be whitespace between a license-id and any following + . This supports easy parsing and backwards compatibility. There MUST be whitespace on either side of the operator \"WITH\". There MUST be whitespace and/or parentheses on either side of the operators AND and OR . Simple License Expressions \u00b6 A simple <license-expression> is composed one of the following: An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier. For example: GPL-2.0 An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier with a unary\"+\" operator suffix to represent the current version of the license or any later version. For example: GPL-2.0+ A SPDX user defined license reference: [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring) Some examples: LicenseRef-23 LicenseRef-MIT-Style-1 DocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2:LicenseRef-MIT-Style-2 Composite License Expressions \u00b6 More expressive composite license expressions can be constructed using \"OR\", \"AND\", and \"WITH\" operators similar to constructing mathematical expressions using arithmetic operators. For the tag:value format, any license expression that consists of more than one license identifier and/or LicenseRef, should be encapsulated by parentheses: \"( )\". This has been specified to facilitate expression parsing. Nested parentheses can also be used to specify an order of precedence which is discussed in more detail in subsection (4). 1) Disjunctive \"OR\" Operator \u00b6 If presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new lincense expression, where both the left and right operands are valid license expression values. For example, when given a choice between the LGPL-2.1 or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: (LGPL-2.1 OR MIT) An example representing a choice between three different licenses would be: (LGPL-2.1 OR MIT OR BSD-3-Clause) 2) Conjunctive \"AND\" Operator \u00b6 If required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are a valid license expression values. For example, when one is required to comply with both the LGPL-2.1 or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: (LGPL-2.1 AND MIT) An example where all three different licenses apply would be: (LGPL-2.1 AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause) 3) Exception \"WITH\" Operator \u00b6 Sometimes a set of license terms apply except under special circumstances. In this case, use the binary \"WITH\" operator to construct a new license expression to represent the special exception situation. A valid <license-expression> is where the left operand is a <simple-expression> value and the right operand is a <license-exception-id> that represents the special exception terms. For example, when the Bison exception is to be applied to GPL-2.0+, the expression would be: (GPL-2.0+ WITH Bison-exception-2.2) The current set of valid exceptions can be found in SPDX License Exception List . If the applicable exception is not found on the SPDX License Exception List, then use a single <license-ref> to represent the entire license terms (including the exception). 4) Order of Precedence and Parentheses \u00b6 The order of application of the operators in an expression matters (similar to mathematical operators). The default operator order of precedence of a <license-expression> a is: + WITH AND OR where a lower order operator is applied before a higher order operator. For example, the following expression: LGPL-2.1 OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT represents a license choice between either LGPL-2.1 and the expression BSD-3-Clause AND MIT because the AND operator takes precedence over (is applied before) the OR operator. When required to express an order of precedence that is different from the default order a <license-expression> can be encapsulated in pairs of parentheses: ( ), to indicate that the operators found inside the parentheses takes precedence over operators outside. This is also similar to the use of parentheses in an algebraic expression e.g., (5+7)/2. For instance, the following expression: (MIT AND (LGPL-2.1+ OR BSD-3-Clause)) states the OR operator should be applied before the AND operator. That is, one should first select between the LGPL-2.1+ or the BSD-3-Clause license before applying the MIT license. 5) License Expressions in RDF \u00b6 A conjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the conjunctive license. Two or more members are required. <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> <spdx:member rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0\"/> <spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about=\"http://example.org#LicenseRef-EternalSurrender\"> <spdx:extractedText> In exchange for using this software, you agree to give its author all your worldly possessions.

Two or more members are required. <spdx:DisjunctiveLicenseSet> <spdx:member rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0\"/> <spdx:member> <spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about=\"http://example.org#LicenseRef-EternalSurrender\"> <spdx:extractedText> In exchange for using this software, you agree to give its author all your worldly possessions.

This element has the following attributes: Comment - An rdfs:comment element describing the nature of the exception. See Also (optional)- An rdfs:seeAlso element referencing external sources of information on the exception. Example - Text describing examples of this exception.
