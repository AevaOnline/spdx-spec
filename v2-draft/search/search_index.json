As part of the conversion-to-ISO-format, its contents have been distributed throughout other clauses and annexes. 1 Rationale 1.1 Charter To create a set of data exchange standards that enable companies and organizations to share human-readable and machine-processable software package metadata to facilitate software supply chain processes. 1.2 Definition The Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX\u00ae) specification is a standard format for communicating the component and metadata information associated with software packages. An SPDX file can be associated with a set of software packages, set of files or snippets and contains information about the software in the SPDX format described in this specification. 1.3 Why is a common format for data exchange needed? Companies and organizations (collectively \u201cOrganizations\u201d) are widely using and reusing open source and other software packages. Accurate identification of software is key for many supply chain processes. Vulnerability remediation starts with knowing the details of which version of software is in use on a system. Compliance with the associated licenses requires a set of analysis activities and due diligence that each Organization performs independently, which may include a manual and/or automated scan of software and identification of associated licenses followed by manual verification. Software development teams across the globe use the same open source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis activities. As a result, many groups are performing the same work leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information. The SPDX working group seeks to create a data exchange format so that information about software packages and related content may be collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving time and improving data accuracy. 1.4 What does this specification cover? 1.4.1 SPDX Document Creation Information: Metadata to associate analysis results with a specific version of the SPDX file and license for use, and provide information on how, when, and by whom the SPDX file was created. 1.4.2 Package Information: Facts that are common properties of an entire package. 1.4.3 File Information: Facts that are specific to files which may be included in packages. 1.4.4 Snippet Information: Facts that are specific to only a part of a file. 1.4.5 Other Licensing Information Detected: A way to capture information about and refer to licenses that are not on the SPDX License List. 1.4.6 Relationships Between SPDX Elements: Information on how Documents, Packages & Files relate to each other. 1.4.7 Annotations: Information about when and by whom the SPDX file was reviewed 1.5 What is not covered in the specification? 1.5.1 Information that cannot be derived from an inspection (whether manual or using automated tools) of the package to be analyzed. 1.5.2 How the data stored in an SPDX file is used by the recipient. 1.5.3 Any identification of any patent(s) which may or may not relate to the package. 1.5.4 Legal interpretation of the licenses or any compliance actions that have been or may need to be taken. 1.5.5 Examples may contain ... which indicate detailed text specific to the SPDX Document 1.6 What does \"Package\" mean in the context of SPDX? In SPDX, a 'Package' refers to any unit of content that can be associated with a distribution of software. Typically, a Package is composed of one or more files. An SPDX document may, but is not required to, provide details about the individual files comprising a Package (see the \"File Information\" details in section 4). Any of the following non-limiting examples may be (but are not required to be) represented in SPDX as a Package: a tarball, zip file or other archive a directory or sub-directory a separately-distributed piece of software which another Package or File uses or depends upon (e.g., a Python package, a Go module, ...) a container image, and/or each image layer within a container image a collection of one or more sub-packages a Git repository snapshot from a particular point in time Note that some of these could be represented in SPDX as a File as well. In an SPDX document, Relationship elements can be used to indicate relationships between Packages, such as dependency relationships. 1.7 Format Requirements 1.7.1 Must be in a human readable form. 1.7.2 Must be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write. 1.7.3 Must be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness automatically, independent of how it was generated (human or tool). 1.7.4 The SPDX file character set must support UTF-8 encoding. 1.7.5 Multiple file formats can be used to represent the information being exchanged. Current supported formats include: YAML 1.2 see: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) see: ECMA-404 The JSON Schema for SPDX can be found in the SPDX Spec Git Repository Schema directory Resource Description Framework (RDF also referred to as RDF/XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/ tag:value flat text file as described in this specification .xls spreadsheets In addition to the supported formats, the following format is in development with a plan to complete the specification by SPDX 3.0: Extensible Markup Language (XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/ 1.7.6 Interoperability between all the supported file formats will be preserved. SPDX defines how to validate a document in each supported format, and how to translate a valid document without loss to each other supported format. 1.7.7 Tags and format properties are case sensitive. 1.7.8 Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file. A suggested naming convention is: Format Extension tag:value *.spdx RDF *.spdx.rdf JSON *.spdx.json XML *.spdx.xml YAML *.spdx.yaml or *.spdx.yml 1.7.9 The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use rdf:about=\"...\" to represent that a proper Universal Resource Indicator (URI) should be present. 1.8 Conformance 1.8.1 A file can be designated an SPDX document, if it is compliant with the requirements of the SPDX Trademark License (See the SPDX Trademark Page on the spdx.org web site). 1.8.2 The official copyright notice to be used with any verbatim reproduction and/or distribution of this SPDX Specification 2.2 is: \"Official SPDX\u00ae Specification 2.2 Copyright \u00a9 2010-2020 Linux Foundation and its Contributors.

It will enable both future changes to the specification and to support backward compatibility. The version number consists of a major and minor version indicator. The major field shall be incremented when incompatible changes between versions are made (one or more sections are created, modified or deleted). The minor field shall be incremented when backwards compatible changes are made. 2.1.2 Intent: Here, parties exchanging information in accordance with the SPDX specification need to provide 100% transparency as to which SPDX specification version such information is conforming to. 2.1.3 Cardinality: Mandatory, one. 2.1.4 Data Format: SPDX-M.N where: M is major version number N is minor version number. 2.1.5 Tag: SPDXVersion: Example: SPDXVersion: SPDX-2.2 2.1.6 RDF: spdx:specVersion Example: <SpdxDocument rdf:about=\"...\"> <specVersion>SPDX-2.2</specVersion> </SpdxDocument> This specification uses the prefix rdf: to refer to the RDF/XML namespace: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# D.2 Data license field 2.2.1 Purpose: Compliance with this document includes populating the SPDX fields therein with data related to such fields (\"SPDX-Metadata\"). This document contains numerous fields where an SPDX document creator may provide relevant explanatory text in SPDX-Metadata. Without opining on the lawfulness of \"database rights\" (in jurisdictions where applicable), such explanatory text is copyrightable subject matter in most Berne Convention countries. By using this document, or any portion hereof, you hereby agree that any copyright rights (as determined by your jurisdiction) in any SPDX-Metadata, including without limitation explanatory text, shall be subject to the terms of the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license. For SPDX-Metadata not containing any copyright rights, you hereby agree and acknowledge that the SPDX-Metadata is provided to you \"as-is\" and without any representations or warranties of any kind concerning the SPDX-Metadata, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. 2.2.2 Intent: This is to alleviate any concern that content (the data or database) in an SPDX file is subject to any form of intellectual property right that could restrict the re-use of the information or the creation of another SPDX file for the same project(s). This approach avoids intellectual property and related restrictions over the SPDX file, however individuals can still contract with each other to restrict release of specific collections of SPDX files (which map to software bill of materials) and the identification of the supplier of SPDX files. 2.2.3 Cardinality: Mandatory, one. 2.2.4 Data Format: CC0-1.0 2.2.5 Tag: DataLicense: Example: DataLicense: CC0-1.0 2.2.6 RDF: spdx:dataLicense Example: <SpdxDocument rdf:about=\"...\"> <dataLicense rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/CC0-1.0\" /> </SpdxDocument> D.3 SPDX identifier field 2.3.1 Purpose: Identify the current SPDX document which may be referenced in relationships by other files, packages internally and documents externally. To reference another SPDX document in total, this identifier should be used with the external document identifier preceding it. See Clause R for examples. 2.3.2 Intent: Provide a way for the document to refer to itself in relationship to other elements. 2.3.3 Cardinality: Mandatory, one. 2.3.4 Data Format: SPDXRef-DOCUMENT 2.3.5 Tag: SPDXID: Example: SPDXID: SPDXRef-DOCUMENT 2.3.6 RDF: The URI for the document is the document namespace appended by #SPDXRef-DOCUMENT <spdx:SpdxDocument rdf:about=\"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/spdx-example-444504E0-4F89-41D3-9A0C-0305E82C33123#SPDXRef-DOCUMENT\"> ... </spdx:SpdxDocument> D.4 Document name field 2.4.1 Purpose: Identify name of this document as designated by creator. 2.4.2 Intent: Here, the name of each document is an important convention and easier to refer to than the URI. 2.4.3 Cardinality: Mandatory, one. 2.4.4 Data Format: Single line of text. 2.4.5 Tag: DocumentName: Example: DocumentName: glibc-v2.3 DocumentName: ubuntu-14.04 2.4.6 RDF: Property spdx:name in class spdx:SpdxDocument Example: <SpdxDocument rdf:about=\"...\"> <name>glibc-v2.3</name> </SpdxDocument> <SpdxDocument rdf:about=\"...\"> <name>ubuntu-14.04</name> </SpdxDocument> D.5 SPDX document namespace field 2.5.1 Purpose: Provide an SPDX document-specific namespace as a unique absolute Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as specified in RFC-3986 , with the exception of the \u2018#\u2019 delimiter. The SPDX Document URI shall not contain a URI \"part\" (e.g. the \"#\" character), since the \u2018#\u2019 is used in SPDX element URIs (packages, files, snippets, etc) to separate the document namespace from the element\u2019s SPDX identifier. Additionally, a scheme (e.g. \u201chttps:\u201d) is required. The URI shall be unique for the SPDX document including the specific version of the SPDX document. If the SPDX document is updated, thereby creating a new version, a new URI for the updated document shall be used. There may only be one URI for an SPDX document and only one SPDX document for a given URI. 2.5.2 Intent: The URI provides an unambiguous mechanism for other SPDX documents to reference SPDX elements within this SPDX document. See D.6 for a description on how external documents are referenced. Although it is not required, the URI can be constructed in a way which provides information on how the SPDX document can be found. For example, the URI can be a URL referencing the SPDX document itself, if it is available on the internet. A best practice for creating the URI for SPDX documents available on the public internet is http://[CreatorWebsite]/[pathToSpdx]/[DocumentName]-[UUID] where: CreatorWebsite is a website hosted by the creator of the document. (e.g. an SPDX document provided by SPDX would be spdx.org) PathToSpdx is a path to where SPDX documents are stored on the website (e.g. /spdx/spdxdocs) DocumentName is a name given to the SPDX Document itself, typically the (set of) package name(s) followed by the version. (See D.4 .) UUID is a universally unique identifier . The UUID could be a version 4 random UUID which can be generated from the Online UUID Generator or a version 5 UUID generated from a sha1 checksum known to be unique for this specific SPDX document version. If the creator does not own their own website, a default SPDX CreatorWebsite and PathToSpdx can be used spdx.org/spdxdocs . Note that the SPDX documents are not currently stored or accessible on this website. The URI is only used to create a unique ID following the above conventions. NOTE The URI does not have to be accessible. It is only intended to provide a unique ID. In many cases, the URI will point to a web accessible document, but this should not be assumed to be the case. 2.5.3 Cardinality: Mandatory, one. 2.5.4 Data Format: unique absolute Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as specified in RFC-3986 , with the following exceptions: The SPDX Document URI shall not contain a URI \"part\" (e.g. the # delimiter), since the # is used to uniquely identify SPDX element identifiers. The URI shall contain a scheme (e.g. https: ). The URI shall be unique for the SPDX document including the specific version of the SPDX document. If the SPDX document is updated, thereby creating a new version, a new URI for the updated document shall be used. There may only be one URI for an SPDX document and only one SPDX document for a given URI. 2.5.5 Tag: DocumentNamespace: Example: DocumentNamespace: http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/spdx-tools-v1.2-3F2504E0-4F89-41D3-9A0C-0305E82... 2.5.6 RDF: The unique ID is the URI for the SPDX document Example: <SpdxDocument rdf:about=\"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/spdx-tools-v1.2-3F2504E0-4F89-41D3-9A0C-0305E82...\"> <rdfs:comment>This document was created using SPDX 2.0 using licenses from the web site.</rdfs:comment> </SpdxDocument> This specification uses the prefix rdfs: to refer to the RDF Schema namespace: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# D.6 External document references field 2.6.1 Purpose: Identify any external SPDX documents referenced within this SPDX document. 2.6.2 Intent: SPDX elements within this document may be related to other SPDX elements referenced from external SPDX documents. An SPDX element could be a snippet, file, package, license reference or SPDX document. 2.6.3 Cardinality: Optional, one or many. 2.6.4 Data Format: DocumentRef- [idstring] [SPDX Document URI] [Checksum] where [idstring] is a unique string containing letters, numbers, . , - and/or + . [SPDX Document URI] is the unique ID for the external document as defined in D.5 of that referenced document, [Checksum] is a checksum of the external document following the checksum format defined in F.4 . 2.6.5 Tag: ExternalDocumentRef: Example: ExternalDocumentRef:DocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2 http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/spdx-tools- v1.2-3F2504E0-4F89-41D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301 SHA1: d6a770ba38583ed4bb4525bd96e50461655d2759 2.6.6 RDF: Property spdx:externalDocumentRef in class spdx:SpdxDocument range ExternalDocumentRef . The ExternalDocumentRef contains two properties: spdxDocument - the SpdxDocument being referenced checksum - the checksum of the referenced SPDX document Example: <externalDocumentRef rdf:ID=\"DocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2\"> <ExternalDocumentRef> <spdxDocument rdf:about=\"http://spdx.org/spdxdocs/spdx-tools-v1.2-3F2504E0-4F89-41D3-9A0C-0305E82...\" /> <checksum> <Checksum> <algorithm rdf:resource=\"checksumAlgorithm_sha1\"/> <checksumValue>d6a770ba38583ed4bb4525bd96e50461655d2758 </checksumValue> </Checksum> </checksum> </ExternalDocumentRef> </externalDocumentRef> NOTE In RDF, a namespace can be created for the external document reference if a short form name for the external reference is desired. D.7 License list version field 2.7.1 Purpose: An optional field for creators of the SPDX file to provide the version of the SPDX License List used when the SPDX file was created. 2.7.2 Intent: Recognizing that licenses are added to the SPDX License List with each subsequent version, the intent is to provide recipients of the SPDX file with the version of the SPDX License List used. This anticipates that in the future, an SPDX file might have used a version of the SPDX License List that is older than the then current one. 2.7.3 Cardinality: Optional, one. 2.7.4 Data Format: M.N where: M is major version number N is minor version number. 2.7.5 Tag: LicenseListVersion: Example: LicenseListVersion: 3.8 2.7.6 RDF: Property licenseListVersion in class spdx:CreationInfo Example: <CreationInfo> <licenseListVersion>3.8</licenseListVersion> </CreationInfo> D.8 Creator field 2.8.1 Purpose: Identify who (or what, in the case of a tool) created the SPDX file.

The SPDX Document URI shall not contain a URI \"part\" (e.g. the \"#\" character), since the \u2018#\u2019 is used in SPDX element URIs (packages, files, snippets, etc) to separate the document namespace from the element\u2019s SPDX identifier. Additionally, a scheme (e.g. \u201chttps:\u201d) is required. The URI shall be unique for the SPDX document including the specific version of the SPDX document. If the SPDX document is updated, thereby creating a new version, a new URI for the updated document shall be used. There may only be one URI for an SPDX document and only one SPDX document for a given URI. 2.5.2 Intent: The URI provides an unambiguous mechanism for other SPDX documents to reference SPDX elements within this SPDX document. See D.6 for a description on how external documents are referenced. Although it is not required, the URI can be constructed in a way which provides information on how the SPDX document can be found. For example, the URI can be a URL referencing the SPDX document itself, if it is available on the internet. A best practice for creating the URI for SPDX documents available on the public internet is http://[CreatorWebsite]/[pathToSpdx]/[DocumentName]-[UUID] where: CreatorWebsite is a website hosted by the creator of the document. (e.g. an SPDX document provided by SPDX would be spdx.org) PathToSpdx is a path to where SPDX documents are stored on the website (e.g. /spdx/spdxdocs) DocumentName is a name given to the SPDX Document itself, typically the (set of) package name(s) followed by the version. (See D.4 .) UUID is a universally unique identifier . The UUID could be a version 4 random UUID which can be generated from the Online UUID Generator or a version 5 UUID generated from a sha1 checksum known to be unique for this specific SPDX document version. If the creator does not own their own website, a default SPDX CreatorWebsite and PathToSpdx can be used spdx.org/spdxdocs . Note that the SPDX documents are not currently stored or accessible on this website. The URI is only used to create a unique ID following the above conventions. NOTE The URI does not have to be accessible. It is only intended to provide a unique ID. In many cases, the URI will point to a web accessible document, but this should not be assumed to be the case. 2.5.3 Cardinality: Mandatory, one. 2.5.4 Data Format: unique absolute Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as specified in RFC-3986 , with the following exceptions: The SPDX Document URI shall not contain a URI \"part\" (e.g. the # delimiter), since the # is used to uniquely identify SPDX element identifiers. The URI shall contain a scheme (e.g. https: ). The URI shall be unique for the SPDX document including the specific version of the SPDX document.

Specifying sub-paths, branch names, a commit hash, a revision or a tag name is recommended, and supported using the @ delimiter for commits and the # delimiter for sub-paths. Using user names and password in the <host_name> is not supported and should be considered as an error. User access control to URLs or VCS repositories must be handled outside of an SPDX document.

If false , indicates packages that represent metadata or URI references to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component. If false , the package shall not contain any files. 3.8.2 Intent: A package can refer to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component that is external to the SPDX document. Some examples: A bundle of external products : Package A can be metadata about Packages and their dependencies. It may also be a loosely organized manifest of references to Packages involved in a product or project. Build or execution may transitively discover more Packages and dependencies. All of these referenced Packages can have their own SPDX Documents. In this case, Package A may be defined with its File Analyzed attribute set to false . Package A includes External Document References to SPDX documents containing Packages referenced in all the available relationships. The Relationships section then relates the SPDX documents and contained SPDX elements with appropriate semantics per the dependencies in the scope of Package A. Package relation to external product : Package A can have a STATIC_LINK relationship to Package B, but the binary representation of Package B is furnished by the build process and thus not contained in the file list of Package A. In this case, Package B needs to be defined with its Files Analyzed attribute set to false and all the other attributes subject to the subsequently defined constraints. Then, the relationship between Package A and Package B can be documented as described in Clause 11 . File derived from external product : Package A contains multiple files derived from an outside project. Rather than use the artifactOf* attributes (F.9-4.11) to describe the relation of these files to their project, the outside project can be represented by another package, Package B, whose FilesAnalyzed attribute is set to false . Each of the binary files can then have a relationship to package B (Clause 10). This allows the outside project to be represented by a single SPDX identifier (the identifier of Package B). It also allows the relationship(s) between the outside project and each of the files be represented in much more detail. 3.8.3 Cardinality: Optional, one. If omitted, the default value of true is assumed. 3.8.4 Data Format: Boolean 3.8.5 Tag: FilesAnalyzed Example: FilesAnalyzed: false 3.8.6 RDF: property spdx:filesAnalyzed in class spdx:Package Example: <Package rdf:about=\"...\"> ... <filesAnalyzed>false</filesAnalyzed> ... </Package> P.9 Package verification code field 3.9.1 Purpose: This field provides an independently reproducible mechanism identifying specific contents of a package based on the actual files (except the SPDX file itself, if it is included in the package) that make up each package and that correlates to the data in this SPDX file. This identifier enables a recipient to determine if any file in the original package (that the analysis was done on) has been changed and permits inclusion of an SPDX file as part of a package. 3.9.2 Intent: Provide a unique identifier based on the files inside each package, eliminating confusion over which version or modification of a specific package the SPDX file refers to. This field also permits embedding the SPDX file within the package without altering the identifier. 3.9.3 Cardinality: Mandatory, one if FilesAnalyzed is true or omitted, zero (must be omitted) if FilesAnalyzed is false . 3.9.4 Algorithm: verificationcode = 0 filelist = templist = \"\" for all files in the package { if file is an \"excludes\" file, skip it /* exclude SPDX analysis file(s) */ append templist with \"SHA1(file)/n\" } sort templist in ascending order by SHA1 value filelist = templist with \"/n\"s removed. /* ordered sequence of SHA1 values with no separators */ verificationcode = SHA1(filelist) Where SHA1(file) applies a SHA1 algorithm on the contents of file and returns the result in lowercase hexadecimal digits.

This identifier enables a recipient to determine if any file in the original package has been changed. If the SPDX file is to be included in a package, this value should not be calculated. The SHA-1 algorithm shall be used to provide the checksum by default. 3.10.2 Intent: Eliminate confusion over which version or modification of a specific package the SPDX file references by providing a unique identifier of the package. 3.10.3 Cardinality: Optional, one or many. 3.10.4 Algorithms that can be used: SHA1 , SHA224 , SHA256 , SHA384 , SHA512 , MD2 , MD4 , MD5 , MD6 3.10.5 Data Format: There are three components, an algorithm identifier (e.g. SHA1 ), a colon separator : , and a bit value represented as lowercase hexadecimal digits (appropriate as output to the algorithm). 3.10.6 Tag: PackageChecksum: Example: PackageChecksum: SHA1: 85ed0817af83a24ad8da68c2b5094de69833983c PackageChecksum: SHA256: 11b6d3ee554eedf79299905a98f9b9a04e498210b59f15094c916c91d150efcd PackageChecksum: MD5: 624c1abb3664f4b35547e7c73864ad24 3.10.7 RDF: properties spdx:algorithm , spdx:checksumValue in class spdx:checksum in class spdx:Package Example: <Package rdf:about=\"...\"> <checksum> <Checksum> <algorithm rdf:resource=\"spdx:checksumAlgorithm_sha1\"/> <checksumValue>85ed0817af83a24ad8da68c2b5094de69833983c</checksumValue> </Checksum> </checksum> <checksum> <Checksum> <algorithm rdf:resource=\"spdx:checksumAlgorithm_sha256\"/> <checksumValue> 11b6d3ee554eedf79299905a98f9b9a04e498210b59f15094c916c91d150efcd </checksumValue> </Checksum> </checksum> <checksum> <Checksum> <algorithm rdf:resource=\"spdx:checksumAlgorithm_md5\"/> <checksumValue>624c1abb3664f4b35547e7c73864ad24</checksumValue> </Checksum> </checksum> </Package> P.11 Package home page field 3.11.1 Purpose: Provide a place for the SPDX file creator to record a web site that serves as the package's home page.

If false , indicates packages that represent metadata or URI references to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component. If false , the package shall not contain any files. 3.8.2 Intent: A package can refer to a project, product, artifact, distribution or a component that is external to the SPDX document. Some examples: A bundle of external products : Package A can be metadata about Packages and their dependencies. It may also be a loosely organized manifest of references to Packages involved in a product or project. Build or execution may transitively discover more Packages and dependencies. All of these referenced Packages can have their own SPDX Documents. In this case, Package A may be defined with its File Analyzed attribute set to false . Package A includes External Document References to SPDX documents containing Packages referenced in all the available relationships. The Relationships section then relates the SPDX documents and contained SPDX elements with appropriate semantics per the dependencies in the scope of Package A. Package relation to external product : Package A can have a STATIC_LINK relationship to Package B, but the binary representation of Package B is furnished by the build process and thus not contained in the file list of Package A. In this case, Package B needs to be defined with its Files Analyzed attribute set to false and all the other attributes subject to the subsequently defined constraints. Then, the relationship between Package A and Package B can be documented as described in Clause 11 . File derived from external product : Package A contains multiple files derived from an outside project. Rather than use the artifactOf* attributes (F.9-4.11) to describe the relation of these files to their project, the outside project can be represented by another package, Package B, whose FilesAnalyzed attribute is set to false . Each of the binary files can then have a relationship to package B (Clause 10). This allows the outside project to be represented by a single SPDX identifier (the identifier of Package B). It also allows the relationship(s) between the outside project and each of the files be represented in much more detail. 3.8.3 Cardinality: Optional, one.

For example, you can represent a relationship between two different Files, between a Package and a File, between two Packages, or between one SPDXDocument and another SPDXDocument. In cases where there are \"known unknowns\", the use of the keyword NOASSERTION can be used on the right hand side of a relationship to indicate that the author is not asserting whether there are other SPDX elements (package/file/snippet) are connected by relationships or not. ie. There could be some, but the author is not asserting one way or another. Similarly, the use of the keywords NONE can be used to indicate that an SPDX element (package/file/snippet) has no other elements connected by some relationship to it. The use of NOASSERTION or NONE is not mandatory for any relationship. If no relationship of a particular type is specified, then the document author is not presumed to be asserting whether or not there are relationships of that type. If some relationships of a particular type are specified, then the document author is not presumed to be asserting whether there are more possible relationships of that type.

There could be some, but the author is not asserting one way or another. Similarly, the use of the keywords NONE can be used to indicate that an SPDX element (package/file/snippet) has no other elements connected by some relationship to it. The use of NOASSERTION or NONE is not mandatory for any relationship. If no relationship of a particular type is specified, then the document author is not presumed to be asserting whether or not there are relationships of that type. If some relationships of a particular type are specified, then the document author is not presumed to be asserting whether there are more possible relationships of that type. The relationships between two SPDX elements that are supported are: Relationship Description Example DESCRIBES Is to be used when SPDXRef-DOCUMENT describes SPDXRef-A.

By providing a short identifier, users can efficiently refer to a license without having to redundantly reproduce the full license. License exceptions can be used with the License Expression Syntax operator, \"WITH\" to create a license with an exception. License Exceptions : The list of commonly found exceptions to open source licenses, which can be used with the License Expression operator, \"WITH\" to create a license with an exception. License List Repository : The HTML pages you see here are generated from the SPDX license-list-XML Repository. The repository contains XML files for all licenses, deprecated licenses, and license exceptions. Overview : For general information about the SPDX License List, including principles for inclusion of a license and an explanation of the fields contained on the list. Matching Guidelines : Guidelines for what constitutes a license match to the SPDX License List. For licenses that include markup, the license text on the HTML pages here will display omitable text in blue and replaceable text in red (see Guideline #2 for more information). Request New License : For instructions on how to propose additional licenses or license exceptions be added to the SPDX License List. The following table contains the full names and short identifiers for the SPDX License List, v3.8 which was released 2020-02-09. For the full and most up-to-date version of the SPDX License List as well as other related information, please see http://spdx.org/licenses/ A.1 Licenses with Short Identifiers Full Name of License Short Identifier OSI?

There is no intent here to make a judgment or interpretation, but merely to ensure that when one SPDX user identifies a license as \"BSD-3-Clause,\" for example, it is indeed the same license as what someone else identifies as \"BSD-3-Clause\" and the same license as what is listed on the SPDX License List. Examples of how to apply some of the matching guidelines to a license or exception are provided via templates. Templates are comprised of technical markup within the master license text file to provide further or specific guidance to SPDX document creators or tool makers. Not all licenses or exceptions will have templates. SPDX License List Matching Guidelines, v2.1 1 How These Guidelines Are Applied 1.1 Purpose To ensure consistent results by different SPDX document creators when matching license information that will be included in the License Information in File field. SPDX document creators or tools may match on the license or exception text itself, the official license header, or the SPDX License List short identifier. 1.1.1 Guideline: Official License Headers The same matching guidelines used for license and exception text apply to the official license headers. Where applicable, an official license header template file with markup is included with the SPDX License List. Official license headers are defined by the SPDX License List as specific text specified within the license itself to be put in the header of files. (see https://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/license-list-overview for more info). 2 Substantive Text 2.1 Purpose To ensure that when matching licenses and exceptions to the SPDX License List, there is an appropriate balance between matching against the substantive text and disregarding parts of the text that do not alter the substantive text. Further guidelines of what can be disregarded or considered replaceable for purposes of matching are listed below here and in the subsequent specific guidelines. A conservative approach is taken in regards to rules about disregarded or replaceable text. 2.1.1 Guideline: Verbatim Text License and exception text should be the same verbatim text (except for the guidelines stated here). The text should be in the same order, e.g., differently ordered paragraphs would not be considered a match. 2.1.2 Guideline: No Additional Text Matched text should only include that found in the vetted license or exception text. Where a license or exception found includes additional text or clauses, this should not be considered a match. 2.1.3 Guideline: Replaceable Text Some licenses include text that refers to the specific copyright holder or author, yet the rest of the license is exactly the same as a generic version. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of a specific name in one part of the license resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match (e.g., the third clause and disclaimer in the BSD licenses, or the third, fourth, and fifth clauses of Apache-1.1). In these cases, there should be a positive license match. Text that can be considered replaceable for matching purposes is indicated in the SPDX License List template with mark-up and in the corresponding HTML pages with colored text. The text indicated as such can be replaced with similar values (e.g., a different name or generic term; different date) and still be considered a positive match. This rule also applies to text-matching in official license headers (see Guideline #1). 2.1.4 Guideline: Omitable Text Some licenses have text that can simply be ignored. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of certain text that is superfluous or irrelevant in regards to the substantive license text resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match (e.g., directions on how to apply the license or other similar non-substantive exhibits). In these cases, there should be a positive license match. Text that can be considered omitable for matching purposes is indicated in the SPDX License List template with mark-up and in the corresponding HTML pages with colored text. The license should be considered a match if the text indicated is present and matches OR the text indicated is missing altogether. 3 Whitespace 3.1 Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to different spacing of words, line breaks, or paragraphs. 3.1.1 Guideline All whitespace should be treated as a single blank space. Templates do not include markup for this guideline. 4 Capitalization 4.1 Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to lower case or upper case letters in otherwise the same words. 4.1.1 Guideline All upper case and lower case letters should be treated as lower case letters. Templates do not include markup for this guideline. 5 Punctuation 5.1 Purpose Because punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence, punctuation needs to be included in the matching process. License template files do not include markup for this guideline. 5.1.1 Guideline: Punctuation Punctuation should be matched, unless otherwise stated in these guidelines. 5.1.2 Guideline: Hyphens, Dashes Any hyphen, dash, en dash, em dash, or other variation should be considered equivalent. 5.1.3 Guideline: Quotes Any variation of quotations (single, double, curly, etc.) should be considered equivalent. 6 Code Comment Indicators 6.1 Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the existence or absence of code comment indicators placed within the license text, e.g. at the start of each line of text. 6.1.1 Guideline Any kind of code comment indicator or prefix which occurs at the beginning of each line in a matchable section should be ignored for matching purposes. Templates do not include markup for this guideline. 7 Bullets and Numbering 7.1 Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the otherwise same license using bullets instead of numbers, number instead of letter, or no bullets instead of bullet, etc., for a list of clauses. 7.1.1 Guideline Where a line starts with a bullet, number, letter, or some form of a list item (determined where list item is followed by a space, then the text of the sentence), ignore the list item for matching purposes. Templates do not include markup for this guideline. 8 Varietal Word Spelling 8.1 Purpose English uses different spelling for some words. By identifying the spelling variations for words found or likely to be found in licenses, we avoid the possibility of a non-match due to the same word being spelled differently. This list is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all spelling variations, but meant to capture the words most likely to be found in open source software licenses. 8.1.1 Guideline The words in each line of the text file available at https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML/blob/master/equivalentwords.txt are considered equivalent and interchangeable. Templates do not include markup for this guideline. 9 Copyright Symbol 9.1 Purpose By having a rule regarding the use of \"\u00a9\", \"(c)\", or \"copyright\", we avoid the possibility of a mismatch based on these variations. 9.1.1 Guideline \"\u00a9\", \"(c)\", or \"Copyright\" should be considered equivalent and interchangeable. Templates do not include markup for this guideline. 10 Copyright Notice 10.1 Purpose To avoid a license mismatch merely because the copyright notice (usually found above the actual license or exception text) is different. The copyright notice is important information to be recorded elsewhere in the SPDX file, but for the purposes of matching a license to the SPDX License List, it should be ignored because it is not part of the substantive license text. 10.1.1 Guideline Ignore copyright notices. A copyright notice consists of the following elements, for example: \"2012 Copyright, John Doe. All rights reserved.\" or \"(c) 2012 John Doe.\" Templates may or may not include markup for this guideline. 11 License Name or Title 11.1 Purpose To avoid a license mismatch merely because the name or title of the license is different than how the license is usually referred to or different than the SPDX full name. This also avoids a mismatch if the title or name of the license is simply not included. 11.1.1 Guideline Ignore the license name or title for matching purposes, so long as what ignored is the title only and there is no additional substantive text added here. Templates do not include markup for this guideline. 12 Extraneous Text At the End of a License 12.1 Purpose To avoid a license mismatch merely because extraneous text that appears at the end of the terms of a license is different or missing. This also avoids a mismatch if the extraneous text merely serves as a license notice example and includes a specific copyright holder's name. 12.1.1 Guideline Ignore any text that occurs after the obvious end of the license and does not include substantive text of the license, for example: text that occurs after a statement such as, \"END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS,\" or an exhibit or appendix that includes an example or instructions on to how to apply the license to your code. Do not apply this guideline or ignore text that is comprised of additional license terms (e.g., permitted additional terms under GPL-3.0, section 7). Templates do not include markup for this guideline. 13 HTTP Protocol 13.1 Purpose To avoid a license mismatch due to a difference in a hyperlink protocol (e.g. http vs. https). 13.1.1 Guideline HTTP:// and HTTPS:// should be considered equivalent. Templates may or may not include markup for this guideline. SPDX License List Template Access The master files for the SPDX License List includes a spreadsheet listing all the licenses, deprecated licenses, and license exceptions; and the text for each license in a .txt file. These files are available in a Git repository . Text that can be considered replaceable or omitable for matching purposes is indicated in the .txt file with markup as per the description below. RDFa Access: The template text for the license can be accessed using the RDF tag licenseTemplate on the web page containing the license. Template Format A template is composed of text with zero or more rules embedded in it. A rule is a variable section of a license wrapped between double angle brackets \u201c<<>>\u201d and is composed of 4 fields. Each field is separated with a semi-colon \u201c;\u201d. Rules cannot be embedded within other rules. Rule fields begin with a case sensitive tag followed by an equal sign \u201c=\u201d. Rule fields: type: indicates whether the text is replaceable or omitable as per Matching Guideline #2 (\u201cSubstantive Text\u201d). Indicated by < > or... Indicated by < > and < > respectively. This field is the first field and is required. name: name of the field in the template. This field is unique within each license template. This field is required. original: the original text of the rule. This field is required for a rule type: < > match: a POSIX extended regular expession (ERE) . This field is required for a rule type: < > The POSIX ERE in the match field has the following restrictions and extensions: Semicolons are escaped with \\; POSIX Bracket Extensions are not allowed Example: <<var;name=organizationClause3;original=the copyright holder;match=.+>>","title":"Appendix II: License Matching Guidelines and Templates"},{"location":"appendix-II-license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/#appendix-ii-license-matching-guidelines-and-templates","text":"The SPDX License List Matching Guidelines provide guidelines to be used for the purposes of matching licenses and license exceptions against those included on the SPDX License List.

SPDX document creators or tools may match on the license or exception text itself, the official license header, or the SPDX License List short identifier. 1.1.1 Guideline: Official License Headers The same matching guidelines used for license and exception text apply to the official license headers. Where applicable, an official license header template file with markup is included with the SPDX License List. Official license headers are defined by the SPDX License List as specific text specified within the license itself to be put in the header of files.

Further guidelines of what can be disregarded or considered replaceable for purposes of matching are listed below here and in the subsequent specific guidelines. A conservative approach is taken in regards to rules about disregarded or replaceable text. 2.1.1 Guideline: Verbatim Text License and exception text should be the same verbatim text (except for the guidelines stated here). The text should be in the same order, e.g., differently ordered paragraphs would not be considered a match. 2.1.2 Guideline: No Additional Text Matched text should only include that found in the vetted license or exception text. Where a license or exception found includes additional text or clauses, this should not be considered a match. 2.1.3 Guideline: Replaceable Text Some licenses include text that refers to the specific copyright holder or author, yet the rest of the license is exactly the same as a generic version. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of a specific name in one part of the license resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match (e.g., the third clause and disclaimer in the BSD licenses, or the third, fourth, and fifth clauses of Apache-1.1). In these cases, there should be a positive license match. Text that can be considered replaceable for matching purposes is indicated in the SPDX License List template with mark-up and in the corresponding HTML pages with colored text. The text indicated as such can be replaced with similar values (e.g., a different name or generic term; different date) and still be considered a positive match. This rule also applies to text-matching in official license headers (see Guideline #1). 2.1.4 Guideline: Omitable Text Some licenses have text that can simply be ignored. The intent here is to avoid the inclusion of certain text that is superfluous or irrelevant in regards to the substantive license text resulting in a non-match where the license is otherwise an exact match (e.g., directions on how to apply the license or other similar non-substantive exhibits). In these cases, there should be a positive license match. Text that can be considered omitable for matching purposes is indicated in the SPDX License List template with mark-up and in the corresponding HTML pages with colored text. The license should be considered a match if the text indicated is present and matches OR the text indicated is missing altogether.","title":"2 Substantive Text"},{"location":"appendix-II-license-matching-guidelines-and-templates/#3-whitespace","text":"3.1 Purpose To avoid the possibility of a non-match due to different spacing of words, line breaks, or paragraphs. 3.1.1 Guideline All whitespace should be treated as a single blank space.

A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-3-Clause). SPDX License Expressions provide a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef- [idString] ; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g., AND , OR , WITH and + ). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid an SPDX License Expression in this section. The exact syntax of license expressions is described below in ABNF . idstring = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" ) license-id = \\ A.1 > license-exception-id = \\ B.2 > license-ref = [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring) simple-expression = license-id / license-id\"+\" / license-ref compound-expression = 1*1(simple-expression / simple-expression \"WITH\" license-exception-id / compound-expression \"AND\" compound-expression / compound-expression \"OR\" compound-expression ) / \"(\" compound-expression \")\" ) license-expression = 1*1(simple-expression / compound-expression) In the following sections we describe in more detail <license-expression> construct, a licensing expression string that enables a more accurate representation of the licensing terms of modern day software. A valid <license-expression> string consists of either: (i) a simple license expression, such as a single license identifier; or (ii) a more complex expression constructed by combining smaller valid expressions using Boolean license operators. There MUST NOT be white space between a license-id and any following + . This supports easy parsing and backwards compatibility. There MUST be white space on either side of the operator \"WITH\". There MUST be white space and/or parentheses on either side of the operators AND and OR . In the tag:value format, a license expression MUST be on a single line, and MUST NOT include a line break in the middle of the expression. D.2 Case sensitivity License expression operators ( AND , OR and WITH ) should be matched in a case-sensitive manner. License identifiers (including license exception identifiers) used in SPDX documents or source code files should be matched in a case-insensitive manner. In other words, MIT , Mit and mIt should all be treated as the same identifier and referring to the same license. However, please be aware that it is often important to match with the case of the canonical identifier on the SPDX License List . This is because the canonical identifier's case is used in the URL of the license's or exception's entry on the List, and because the canonical identifier is translated to a URI in RDF documents. D.3 Simple license expressions A simple <license-expression> is composed one of the following: An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier. For example: CDDL-1.0 An SPDX License List Short Form Identifier with a unary \"+\" operator suffix to represent the current version of the license or any later version. For example: CDDL-1.0+ A SPDX user defined license reference: [\"DocumentRef-\"1*(idstring)\":\"]\"LicenseRef-\"1*(idstring) Some examples: LicenseRef-23 LicenseRef-MIT-Style-1 DocumentRef-spdx-tool-1.2:LicenseRef-MIT-Style-2 D.4 Composite license expressions D.4.1 Introduction More expressive composite license expressions can be constructed using \"OR\", \"AND\", and \"WITH\" operators similar to constructing mathematical expressions using arithmetic operators. For the tag:value format, any license expression that consists of more than one license identifier and/or LicenseRef, may optionally be encapsulated by parentheses: \"( )\". Nested parentheses can also be used to specify an order of precedence which is discussed in more detail in subsection (4). D.4.2 Disjunctive \"OR\" Operator If presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are valid license expression values. For example, when given a choice between the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT An example representing a choice between three different licenses would be: LGPL-2.1-only OR MIT OR BSD-3-Clause D.4.3 Conjunctive \"AND\" Operator If required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression, where both the left and right operands are a valid license expression values. For example, when one is required to comply with both the LGPL-2.1-only or MIT licenses, a valid expression would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT An example where all three different licenses apply would be: LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause D.4.4 Exception \"WITH\" Operator Sometimes a set of license terms apply except under special circumstances. In this case, use the binary \"WITH\" operator to construct a new license expression to represent the special exception situation. A valid <license-expression> is where the left operand is a <simple-expression> value and the right operand is a <license-exception-id> that represents the special exception terms. For example, when the Bison exception is to be applied to GPL-2.0-or-later, the expression would be: GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2 The current set of valid exceptions can be found in Annex A.2 . For the most up to date set of exceptions please see spdx.org/licenses . If the applicable exception is not found on the SPDX License Exception List, then use a single <license-ref> to represent the entire license terms (including the exception). D.4.5 Order of Precedence and Parentheses The order of application of the operators in an expression matters (similar to mathematical operators). The default operator order of precedence of a <license-expression> a is: + WITH AND OR where a lower order operator is applied before a higher order operator. For example, the following expression: LGPL-2.1-only OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT represents a license choice between either LGPL-2.1-only and the expression BSD-3-Clause AND MIT because the AND operator takes precedence over (is applied before) the OR operator. When required to express an order of precedence that is different from the default order a <license-expression> can be encapsulated in pairs of parentheses: ( ), to indicate that the operators found inside the parentheses takes precedence over operators outside. This is also similar to the use of parentheses in an algebraic expression e.g., (5+7)/2. For instance, the following expression: MIT AND (LGPL-2.1-or-later OR BSD-3-Clause) states the OR operator should be applied before the AND operator. That is, one should first select between the LGPL-2.1-or-later or the BSD-3-Clause license before applying the MIT license. D.4.6 License Expressions in RDF A conjunctive license can be expressed in RDF via a <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> element, with an spdx:member property for each element in the conjunctive license. Two or more members are required. <spdx:ConjunctiveLicenseSet> <spdx:member rdf:resource=\"http://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0-only\"/> <spdx:ExtractedLicensingInfo rdf:about=\"http://example.org#LicenseRef-EternalSurrender\"> <spdx:extractedText> In exchange for using this software, you agree to give its author all your worldly possessions.

For example, the following expression: LGPL-2.1-only OR BSD-3-Clause AND MIT represents a license choice between either LGPL-2.1-only and the expression BSD-3-Clause AND MIT because the AND operator takes precedence over (is applied before) the OR operator. When required to express an order of precedence that is different from the default order a <license-expression> can be encapsulated in pairs of parentheses: ( ), to indicate that the operators found inside the parentheses takes precedence over operators outside. This is also similar to the use of parentheses in an algebraic expression e.g., (5+7)/2.

That mechanism is intentionally very easy for software tools to identify and detect, since it includes a standard text string that is unlikely to occur in other contexts, and since it uses license identifiers from the SPDX License List or from user-defined LicenseRef- statements. The SPDX specification defines various other fields in the File Information section (Clause 8 ) that are also useful for conveying information on a file-by-file basis. For example, the REUSE Software guidelines community expressed interest in having a similar method to recommend that developers use to express their copyright notices in a machine-readable manner. This appendix describes a mechanism, similar to SPDX-License-Identifier , for developers to convey such other file-based information easily in comments in their files. This in turn enables software tools to easily find and extract that information, and to insert it into the corresponding fields of an SPDX document generated by those tools. I.2 Format An SPDX file tag consists of a single line, generally as part of a comment near the top of the file, in the following format: SPDX-tagname: <value> where tagname is replaced by the 'tag' defined for tag-value SPDX documents for that field, according to the File Information section of the SPDX specification. The meaning and semantics of any SPDX file tag are intended to be identical to those described in the File Information section of the SPDX specification.

File contributors (see 8.14 ): SPDX-FileContributor: Modified by Jane Doe SPDX-FileContributor: The Regents of the University of California SPDX file tags of a particular type may appear one or multiple times in a file, depending on the corresponding cardinality defined for that field in the File Information section of the SPDX specification. Multiple-line values are not recommended, because doing so will make it harder for simple search tools to extract all data by looking only for lines beginning with the relevant tag. Version 3.0 of the REUSE Software guidelines implements this format, via a recommendation to use the tag SPDX-FileCopyrightText: to include copyright notices as part of a file's comment headers. I.3 Caveats A creator of an SPDX document may elect to disregard any or all file tags in any file. SPDX document creators should determine for themselves the extent to which they will rely upon the information specified in a file tag. Not all fields in the File Information section will be useful or relevant to use as file tags. For example, SPDX-FileName is unnecessary as it can be easily derived from the actual file name; SPDX-SPDXID is likely to be ignored by an SPDX document creator who may need to define their own SPDXRef- ID system for their document; etc. The short-form license identifiers described in Annex E do not follow the file tag convention described above.

An SPDX short identifier is immutable. Easy look-ups and cross-references to the SPDX License List website. To the extent that a source file contains existing copyright and license information, it is the SPDX project\u2019s recommendation that SPDX short identifiers be used to supplement, not replace that information. When there is a standard header provided by the license author, it is recommended to use such standard header (alone or in combination with the SPDX short identifier). If using SPDX short identifiers in individual files, it is recommended to reproduce the full license in the projects LICENSE file and indicate that SPDX short identifiers are being used to refer to it. For links to projects illustrating these scenarios, see https://spdx.org/ids-where . E.2 Format for SPDX-License-Identifier The SPDX-License-Identifier tag declares the license the file is under and should be placed at or near the top of the file in a comment. To the extent that the file contains existing license information, it is our recommendation that the tag be used to supplement not replace that information. Of course, this is the ultimate decision of the copyright holders of the file. The SPDX License Identifier syntax may consist of a single license (represented by a short identifier from the SPDX license list ) or a compound set of licenses (represented by joining together multiple licenses using the license expression syntax). The tag should appear on its own line in the source file, generally as part of a comment. SPDX-License-Identifier: \\<SPDX License Expression> E.3 Representing single license A single license is represented by using the short identifier from SPDX license list , optionally with a unary \"+\" operator following it to indicate \"or later\" versions may be applicable. Examples: SPDX-License-Identifier: CDDL-1.0+ SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT E.4 Representing multiple licenses Multiple licenses can be represented using a SPDX license expression as defined in Annex D . A set of licenses may optionally be enclosed in parentheses, but are not required to be enclosed. As further described there: When there is a choice between licenses (\"disjunctive license\"), they should be separated with \"OR\". If presented with a choice between two or more licenses, use the disjunctive binary \"OR\" operator to construct a new license expression. Similarly when multiple licenses need to be simultaneously applied (\"conjunctive license\"), they should be separated with \"AND\". If required to simultaneously comply with two or more licenses, use the conjunctive binary \"AND\" operator to construct a new license expression. In some cases, a set of license terms apply except under special circumstances, in this case, use the \"WITH\" operator followed by one of the recognized exception identifiers . The expression MUST be on a single line, and MUST NOT include a line break in the middle of the expression. Examples: SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only OR MIT SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-2-Clause SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2 Please see Annex D for more examples and details of the license expression specific syntax.

TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 1) Definitions a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License. c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership. d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License. e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast. f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work. g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium. 2) Fair Dealing Rights . Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws. 3) License Grant . Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\"; c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. e. For the avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes . In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary License Schemes . The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. 4) Restrictions . The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5) Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6) Limitation on Liability . EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7) Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8) Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.","title":"Appendix VII: Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported"},{"location":"appendix-VII-creative-commons-attribution-license-3.0-unported/#annex-g-creative-commons-attribution-license-30-unported","text":"License THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\").

If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 5) Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 6) Limitation on Liability . EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 7) Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 8) Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.","title":"Annex G Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 Unported"},{"location":"appendix-VIII-SPDX-Lite/","text":"Annex H SPDX Lite H.1 Explanation of SPDX Lite The SPDX Lite profile defines a subset of the SPDX specification, from the point of view of use cases in some industries.

The following subclauses introduce the different kinds of Facts allowed. The fields for each kind of Fact are defined in the clause corresponding to that Fact. 5.2 Facts 5.2.1 SPDX document creation information Fact An instance of this kind of Fact provides the necessary information for forward and backward compatibility for processing tools. One instance shall be present for each SPDX file produced. Cardinality: Mandatory, one. See Clause 6 for details of the fields in this kind of Fact. 5.2.2 Package information Fact If SPDX information is organized by grouping into packages, then one instance of the Package Information per package being described shall exist. A package may contain sub-packages, but the information in this section is a reference to the entire contents of the package listed. Starting with SPDX 2.0, it is not necessary to have a package wrapping a set of files. Cardinality: Optional, one or many. In tag:value format, the order in which package and files occur is syntactically significant. A new Package Information section is denoted by the Package Name field. All Package Information fields shall be grouped together before the start of a Files section , if file(s) are present. All files contained in a package shall immediately follow the applicable Package Information. A new Package Information section (via Package Name) denotes the start of another package. Sub-packages shall not be nested inside a Package Information section, but shall be separate and shall use a Relationship to clarify. Annotations and Relationships for the package may appear after the Package Information before any file information. See Clause 7 for details of the fields in this kind of Fact. 5.2.3 File information Fields One instance of the File Information shall exist for each file in the software package. It provides important meta information about a given file including licenses and copyright. Starting with SPDX 2.0, it is not necessary to have a package wrapping a set of files. When implementing tag:value format, the positioning of File elements is syntactically significant: Files are assumed to be associated with the Package Information that immediately precedes it, if a package exists. Presence of a new Package Information signals the end of the set of files associated with the preceding package, unless an explicit Relationship is used. If a package contains files, the File Information section shall follow its Package Information section. If a File is not part of any package, it shall precede any Package Information section reference in the SPDX document. The first field to start off the description of a File shall be the File Name in tag:value format. File information is associated with the File Name that precedes it. Annotations on the file and Relationships from the file may appear after the file information, before the next file or Package Information section. When implementing file information in RDF, the spdx:hasFile property is used to associate the package with the file. See Clause 8 for details of the fields in this kind of Fact. 5.2.4 Snippet information Fact Snippets can optionally be used when a file is known to have some content that has been included from another original source. They are useful for denoting when part of a file may have been originally created under another license. Each instance of Snippet Information shall be associated with a specific File in an SPDX Document. When implementing tag:value format, the positioning of Snippet elements is syntactically significant: If a File contains Snippets, the Snippet Information section shall follow a related File Information section (if it exists in the document). Presence of a new file or package section signals the end of the set of snippets associated with the original file, unless an explicit Relationship is used. The first field to start off the description of a Snippet shall be the Snippet Identifier in tag:value format. Annotations on the Snippet and Relationships from the Snippet may appear after the Snippet Information, before the next file or Package section. See Clause 9 for details of the fields in this kind of Fact. 5.2.5 Other licensing information detected This section is used for any detected, declared or concluded licenses that are NOT on the SPDX License List. For the most up-to-date version of the list, see https://spdx.org/licenses/ . The SPDX License List can also be found here in Annex A . One instance shall be created for every unique license or licensing information reference detected in package that does not match one of the licenses on the SPDX License List. Each license instance should have the following fields. See Clause 10 for details of the fields in this kind of Fact. 5.2.6 Relationships Between SPDX Elements Fact ToDo: there was no intro text in Chapter 7 to move here, but, presumably, we should say something. See Clause 11 for details of the fields in this kind of Fact. 5.2.7 Annotations Fact ToDo: there was no intro text in Chapter 8 to move here, but, presumably, we should say something. See Clause 12 for details of the fields in this kind of Fact. 5.2.8 Review information Fact The review information section is included for compatibility with SPDX 1.2, and is deprecated since SPDX 2.0. Any review information shall use an Annotation (as described in Clause 12 ) with an annotation type of REVIEW . Review information may be added after the initial SPDX file has been created. The set of fields are optional and multiple instances may be added. Once a Reviewer entry is added, the Review Date associated with the review is mandatory. The Created date shall not be modified as a result of the addition of information regarding the conduct of a review. A Review Comments is optional. See Clause 13 for details of the fields in this kind of Fact. 5.3 Fact organization Within an SPDX document, Facts may be organized, as follows: 5.4 What this specification does not cover This document does not address the following: Information that cannot be derived from an inspection (whether manual or using automated tools) of the package to be analyzed.

[Those earlier editions are: 1.0 (August 2011), 1.1 (August 2012), 1.2 (October 2013), 2.0 (May 2015), 2.1 (November 2016), and 2.2 (May 2020).] Differences between this edition and earlier ones are reported in Annex XX . 4.2 Obsolete features Over the life of a standard, some older approaches can become obsolete and are dropped from subsequent editions, possibly with a replacement approach being provided. Such action involves deprecating those out-dated features. This edition identifies all currently deprecated features. 4.3 Alternate notation for some requirements This standard contains more than a few cardinality assertions , each of which indicates absolute, optional, or conditional requirements. Here are some examples: Cardinality: Mandatory, one. Cardinality: Optional, one or many. Cardinality: Mandatory, one if is true or omitted, zero (must be omitted) if is false. Each of these assertions can easily be understood as to whether a feature is required, and if so, how many occurrences are required; also whether a feature is permitted, and if so, in what number. As this is the format long familiar to the SPDX community, it has been preserved in this document. 4.4 Standard data format requirements The data format specification and recommendations are subject to the following: Shall be in a human readable form. Shall be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write. Shall be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness automatically, independent of how it was generated (human or tool). The SPDX file character set shall support UTF-8 encoding. Multiple file formats may be used to represent the information being exchanged. Current supported formats include: YAML 1.2 see: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) see: ECMA-404 The JSON Schema for SPDX can be found in the SPDX Spec Git Repository Schema directory Resource Description Framework (RDF also referred to as RDF/XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/ tag:value flat text file as described in this specification .xls spreadsheets In addition to the supported formats, the following format is in development with a plan to complete the specification in the next release: Extensible Markup Language (XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/ Interoperability between all the supported file formats shall be preserved. SPDX defines how to validate a document in each supported format, and how to translate a valid document without loss to each other supported format. Tags and format properties are case sensitive. Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file. A suggested naming convention is: Format Extension tag:value *.spdx RDF *.spdx.rdf JSON *.spdx.json XML *.spdx.xml YAML *.spdx.yaml or *.spdx.yml The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use rdf:about=\"...\" to represent that a proper Universal Resource Indicator (URI) should be present. 4.5 ???

Shall be in a syntax that a software tool can read and write. Shall be suitable to be checked for syntactic correctness automatically, independent of how it was generated (human or tool). The SPDX file character set shall support UTF-8 encoding. Multiple file formats may be used to represent the information being exchanged. Current supported formats include: YAML 1.2 see: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) see: ECMA-404 The JSON Schema for SPDX can be found in the SPDX Spec Git Repository Schema directory Resource Description Framework (RDF also referred to as RDF/XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/ tag:value flat text file as described in this specification .xls spreadsheets In addition to the supported formats, the following format is in development with a plan to complete the specification in the next release: Extensible Markup Language (XML) see: https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/ Interoperability between all the supported file formats shall be preserved. SPDX defines how to validate a document in each supported format, and how to translate a valid document without loss to each other supported format. Tags and format properties are case sensitive. Should be easy to recognize in a file system without opening the file. A suggested naming convention is: Format Extension tag:value *.spdx RDF *.spdx.rdf JSON *.spdx.json XML *.spdx.xml YAML *.spdx.yaml or *.spdx.yml The convention in this specification is for the RDF examples to use rdf:about=\"...\" to represent that a proper Universal Resource Indicator (URI) should be present.","title":"4.4 Standard data format requirements"},{"location":"conformance/#45-heading-tbd","text":"TODO: Write an intro para here.
